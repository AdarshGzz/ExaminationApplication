          Passage You want to hit a small box on the floor with a marble fired
          from a spring-loaded gun that is mounted on a table. The target box is
          a distance R horizontally from the edge of the table; see the figure
          to the right. You compress the spring a distanced, but the center of
          the marble falls short by a distance r of the center of the box. How
          far should you compress the spring to score a direct hit (neglect
          friction)?
